        <h1>Understanding Java Streams</h1>

            <h2>What is a Java Stream?</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>** NOTE: I am talking about Java 8 Stream API, not java.io</strong><br><br>
                A stream is simply an iteration. Items pass through a stream in hopes of being 
                manipulated in different ways.
            </p>
            <h2>What is a visual way to think of a Stream?</h2>

            <p>
                Streams were my introduction to functional programming. A very simple concept
                that took me some time to understand. I often see people confused by streams,
                and I was too at a point in time. Hopefully this helps you understand streams
                with ease.

            <p class="legend">Streams are just pipelines. Let's make it simple.</p>
            <p>
                Streams really don't have to be hard. I like to think of streams like a <strong>pipeline</strong>,
                all the items in the stream loop through this pipe until a terminal operator is called.
                Another way of thinking of this terminal operator is the <strong>exit of pipe contents</strong> 
                into a body of water.
            </p>
            <h2>What about reduction?</h2>
            <p>
                So, what about <strong>filtering</strong>?
                Filtering a stream reminds me of
                actual water filtering. For example, let's
                say we wanted to <i>filter</i> a list of pets to
                only ones with a type of dog. The code would
                look something like the following: (this example 
                does not contain presence checks, but we will get to that later)
            </p><br>
            
            <pre>
                List&lt;Pet&gt;</span><span> pets = </span><span class="new">new</span><span> ArrayList&lt;Pet&gt;()<span class="curl"> {{</span>
                    add(<span class="new">new</span> Dog());
                    add(<span class="new">new</span> Cat());
                    add(<span class="new">new</span> Pet());
                    add(<span class="new">new</span> Dog());
                <span class="curl">}}</span>;

                long dogCount = pets.stream()
                    .filter(pet -> pet <span class="new">instanceof</span> Dog)
                    .count();
                
                System.out.println(dogCount); <span class="comment">// prints 2</span>
            </pre><br>

            <p>
                So, this reminds me of one of the options to filter water (thanks, science class)! 
                <strong>Reverse osmosis</strong> acts like a filter which <strong>only</strong> 
                lets water particles pass through a membrane. We are doing the same thing, but instead 
                of filtering water, we are filtering dogs.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you do not understand this science concept well enough, it is a good
                idea to think of strean filtering like a coffee filter, or a metal grid instead.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's take a look at the <i>reduce</i> operator in streams. This operator repeatedly 
                combines all elements in a stream until there is only one left. <i>sum</i>, <i>collect</i>, 
                <i>count</i>, etc, are all forms of reduce <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/package-summary.html#Reduction">(more info here)</a>
