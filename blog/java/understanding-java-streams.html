            <h2>What is a Java Stream?</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>** NOTE: I am talking about Java 8 Stream API, not java.io</strong><br><br>
                A stream is simply an iteration. Items pass through a stream in hopes of being manipulated in different ways.

            <h2>What is a visual way to think of a Stream?</h2>

            <p>
                Streams were my introduction to functional programming. A very simple concept
                that took me some time to understand. I often see people confused by streams,
                and I was too at a point in time. Hopefully this helps you understand streams
                with ease.

            <p>
                Streams really don't have to be hard. I like to think of streams like a pipeline,
                all the items in the stream loop through this pipe until a terminal operator is called.
                Another way of thinking of this terminal operator is the exit of pipe contents into a 
                body of water.
